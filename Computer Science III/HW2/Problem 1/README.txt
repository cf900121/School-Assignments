Problem #1:
I started this problem by first writing out all of the possible digits on a piece of paper, the way they would look with dashes and lines. Then, I transferred these models into the code using strings. My first output had all of the numbers displayed from top to bottom in the console. (i.e) 1 at the top, 9 at the bottom. Obviously this wasn't what I needed because the numbers had to display from left to right. I realized that I clearly wouldn't be able to print out an entire number at once if I wanted them on the same line, so I set the string for each line of all the numbers into an array. For example, the first line of the number 0 would be " --  "
My next step was to create a loop that would print all the numbers from left to right using the array. After that, it was a short trip to figuring out how to manipulate the order of the numbers based on the input. All it took was a switch statement inside of the loop that would write the tops of each number or character and continue on down to completion.
