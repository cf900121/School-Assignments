Problem #2:
Obviously, the first thing that I did for problem 2 was look up Zeller's Formula. It took me a bit to fully understand what it's purpose was. Once I did, I started coding. I grabbed input from the user for the year and month. To utilize Zeller's Formula, I had to seperate the ending digits of the year from the first digit, which is the century digit. The main difficulty with generating the calender was figuring out how to get the dates in their appropriate spots because, for example, the 1st of the month isn't always a Saturday. So I created a string for each day of the week. If this string is used, it means that the 1st of the month is on that day of the week. The reason for the seperate strings is because depending on what day the month starts, the spacing is different. It made it so that I could manipulate where the next line would begin. The "spaces" strings are used to created spaces on the 1st line of the calender depending on what day the month starts. For example, if the 1st is on wednesday, there should be no digits before the 1 under the wednesday mark. The other main difficulty was figuring out how I would add the extra days of the month, because each month has a different number of them. So, I just made all of the strings have all 31 possible days in a month, and using stringbuilder and a switch statement, I deleted the appropriate amount of days off of the string for the given month.
